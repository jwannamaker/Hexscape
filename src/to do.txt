- add bfs algorithm for proceedurally generating a maze
- initialize each of them as a 'wall'
- save the tilemap in a .json

-- introduce new mechanic where the ball glows stronger and stronger
    the closer you are to the 'goalpoints'

-- add a dialog to the game
    -> the big picture should be that you can't go back. you can't know
    if which way youre heading is the right way or not, but you have to 
    keep moving.
    -> emphasis on memory, sounds, attention to details

-- add controls/actions
    -> place a waypoint
    -> send out a sound, an echolocation of sorts. 
    -> GREEN highlights the other waypoints on the map temporarily
    -> RED lets you tear through walls temporarily
    -> YELLOW/ORGANGE lights up all the tiles surrounding you temporarily
    -> PURPLE* lets you teleport? maybe faintly highlight the places you 
        should be moving to?

-- ethereal music
