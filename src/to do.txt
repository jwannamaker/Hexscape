- save the tilemap in a .json

-- ball glows stronger and stronger the closer you are to the 'waypoints'

-- add a dialog to the game
    -> the big picture should be that you can't go back. you can't know
    if which way youre heading is the right way or not, but you have to 
    keep moving.
    - emphasis on memory, sounds, attention to details
    - "Where am I?"
    - "What am I doing here?"
    - "I guess all I can do is keep moving..."
    - (*after some momentum is gained) "I know I can find a way."

-- add waypoints and rooms around them
    -> RED lets you break through walls temporarily
    -> ORANGE lights the path to the nearest waypoint temporarily
    -> YELLOW lights up all the tiles surrounding you (and the walls) temporarily
    -> GREEN highlights the other waypoints on the map temporarily
    -> PURPLE teleports you to another waypoint (or within __(randint(level-1, level+1))__ distance of one)
    -> BLUE boosts every move to the longest possible (**find a better way to phrase this lmao)

-- add excitement to the music
    -> add a layer to the music for each waypoint discovered
    -> needs a good kick drum line
    -> snare
    -> hihat
    -> guitar
